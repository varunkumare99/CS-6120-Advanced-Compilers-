# CS 6120: Advanced Compilers 
[cs6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120/2022sp/syllabus/)

It covers universal compilers topics like intermediate representations, data flow, and “classic” optimizations as well as more research-flavored topics such as parallelization, just-in-time compilation, and garbage collection. The work consists of reading papers and open-source hacking tasks, which use LLVM and an educational IR invented just for this class.

## Projects
